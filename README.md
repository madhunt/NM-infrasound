Madeline Hunt's research for Dr. Lees in Spring 2020. This is my senior research project analyzing infrasound data from explosions in New Mexico.

This code uses the obspy package.


*STALTA.py*
This reads in the data and uses obspy's Short-Term-Average-Long-Term-Average function to pick out events in the data.
